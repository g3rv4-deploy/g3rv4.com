My very first blog post :)

<!--more-->
I couldn't think of a better title for my first post than Hello World!

This is just a place for me to write about the stuff I find interesting to play with, problems that puzzled me (and hopefully solved) and personal projects I work on... If a blog post saves a few minutes of your life, then it was worth it.

I'm a Software Engineer from Uruguay (little country in South America), but I'll post on English only b/c I have a hidden agenda:
* I want to improve my English (by forcing me to write)
* I don't want to limit the comments / connections to Spanish speakers

I'll just write about stuff that I think is worth sharing... my goal is not to have a group of loyal readers (I'm not a good writer in my mother tongue, I'll definitely be mediocre in English) but to have people come to this blog from google when looking for solutions to particular problems (as I've done with so many other blogs).

So, this is a Hello World! that, as almost every other Hello World! is just to start making me feel comfortable in this new environment.
