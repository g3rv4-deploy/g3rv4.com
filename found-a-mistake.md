title: Did you find a mistake?
---
As you probably noticed, I'm not a native English speaker. But not only that, my English is somewhat limited as well (I suck at small talk in English, but I swear I'm kind of witty in Spanish!). So, if you found a mistake, you can:

* [Send me a pull request](https://github.com/g3rv4/g3rv4.com) (the articles and pages are written in markdown, so it should be super straightforward to fix anything)
* [Mention me on twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?user_id=77212546)

Either way, thanks for caring!
